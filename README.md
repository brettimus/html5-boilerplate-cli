# html5 boilerplate (cli)
:runner: this was just a quick script, but it'd be fun to add some options to it!


Also, considering taking the 5 out of the command because it's annoying. Thoughts?
## Usage
It's dead easy!

Copy all html5 bp into `./pretty-web-site`.
```sh
mkdir pretty-web-site
cd pretty-web-site
html5bp
```

Copy all html5 bp into `/path/to/pretty-web-site`
```sh
html5bp /path/to/pretty-web-set
```

## Use your own templates
Place the templates you'd like to use in `~/.html5bp/*`. (Sorry, Windows folk, but this will won't work for ya.)
